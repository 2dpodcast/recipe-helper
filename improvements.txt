it currently times out due to inactivity, and it doesn't seem like it can be circumvented
maybe host user progress/sessions on a server, so they can relaunch the software and pick up where they left off

add ability to repeat instructions, or remove ingredients (for misidentifications)

add "fuzzy search" so ingredients don't have to match 100%
if they're missing an ingredient or two, it can recommend them

remove more basic ingredients from matching list, so users don't have to say salt, cooking oil, etc.
also water

with more time and money, we would use a web api to automatically search recipes

the json schema could be refined for easier sorting/searching

speech could be improved, to handle different nouns, instead of saying stuff like "eight of apples"

add a sort of game element, where you get points, especially for making more complicated recipes
add a learning progression, where recipes get more and more difficult as time goes on
possibly team up with food providers for "rewards" based on points gained

move code into functions

add name aliases for ingredients - especially to handle plurals

create README/LICENSE (MIT), structure files better (examples in own directory)
make things less hacky

push this to a public git repo

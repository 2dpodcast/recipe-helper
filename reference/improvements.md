* Skill times out due to inactivity; can't be circumvented
* Can possibly save sessions on remote server for easy resuming


* Add ability to: deny recipe (find different one), say multiple ingredients at once (doesn't work very well with speech recognition)


* Add fuzzy search to match partial ingredients list
* Recommend missing ingredients (if there aren't many)
* Remove basic ingredients (water, cooking oil, etc.) from match list (so users don't have to say them)


* With more time and money: use web API to search recipes by ingredients
* Improve JSON schema for easier sorting/searching


* Improve noun handling (no "eight of apples")


* Add game elements - more points for more complicated recipes
* Add learning progression - suggested recipes increase in difficulty
* Create partnerships for food/supermarket-based rewards using points

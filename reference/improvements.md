* Can possibly save sessions on remote server for easy resuming


* Add ability to: remove ingredients (for misidentifications), deny recipe (find different one)


* Add fuzzy search to match partial ingredients list

* Improve JSON schema for easier sorting/searching
* Add ingredient aliases (especially for plurals - allow full matches for ingredients)


* Improve noun handling (no "eight of apples")


* Add game elements - more points for more complicated recipes

## About this project

Recipe Helper was built at Rochester Institute of Technology during the
24-hour hackathon BrickHack 3 by Jason Puglisi and Adam Duvin. The Echo
hardware was rented out during the event for development and testing. Neither
creator owns an Echo, so don't count on future updates/refinement. Feel free to
fork this though or use it as a reference.

See reference/improvements.md for things we think would be cool if this was a
professional project.

## How to use

This skill isn't published anywhere but here. You can follow a simple Alexa
development tutorial to set it up and use it yourself. Beware that it's very
limited though.

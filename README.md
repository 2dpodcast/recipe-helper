# Recipe Helper

Alexa skill to find cooking recipes using provided ingredients.

## Usage

This skill is not hosted anywhere, but you can set it up in your own testing
environment using the Alexa section of the Amazon Developer website.

## Overview

Takes a list of ingredients and matches them to a static list of recipes.
Current functionality is very limited in many ways. See
[`reference/improvements.md`](reference/improvements.md) for some possible
improvements that could be made.
